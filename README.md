I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
My name is Andi Pasca Hasanuddin
I am 22 years old
Freshly graduated from college (about to hit 1 year to be exact)
Currently working as a content review analyst
It is not an IT job
But I love the fact that it incenuates the value of work life balance
So I can come to a sense that time is the most valuable sort of substance on your life rather than money
And it helped me to develop my interest in IT, from a mere school stuff, to an actual life changing world.
My plan is to go back into the IT world, after 1 year of being abstein
I love my job, I think it gave me so much of new lessons which I figured I wouldn't get back when studying in IT major.
But I also know that my brain hungers for complexity and problem solving.
And I found that in IT.
There are just so much discoveries in IT, and it is un-ending.
It seems massive and heavy, but perhaps that's why I liked it on the first place.
Because it is challenging. And I am a man grew up for challenges.
So yeah, there's that.
During my leisure time, I like to read, and city strolling, capturing photos of buildings and city sightseeing.
I also love to eat, freshy foods.
My virtue is loyalty, and patience.
I used to be very negative, but I'd rather say realistic, sounds more like it. People see me as a gloomy, while I was just telling what was happening.
That's why I found out that being negative also means being small, we will always be right, we will always seem right by being so.
So I decided to put my pain and all the terrible things happened to me inside, but not to dominate me, but to fight the world with me, alongside myself. After all, I am the person today because of the person I was.
This 1 year after college era has given me a lot of meaningful lessons.
And it has put me to a great stance of readiness.
Now I am ready to go back and re-conquer my greatness.
So yeah, I think that's a brief story about me.
